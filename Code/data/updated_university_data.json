Other distinguished graduates include Michelle Obama, actors Jimmy Stewart and Brooke Shields, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Apollo astronaut Pete Conrad.Princeton, which is consistently ranked among the world\u2019s top 10 universities, is renowned for its campus\u2019 park-like beauty as well as some of its landmark buildings, designed by some of America\u2019s most well-known architects. For instance, its Lewis Library was designed by Frank Gehry and contains many of the university\u2019s science collections. Its McCarter Theatre Center has won a Tony Award for the best regional theatre in the country.Spread across 500 acres, the Princeton campus has about 180 buildings, including 10 libraries containing about 14 million holdings. It is popular with visitors, with about 800,000 people visiting its open campus each year, generating about $2 billion in revenue.The Princeton area, which has a population of about 30,000 residents, is also something of a destination itself, with many attracted by its tree-lined streets and wide variety of shops, restaurants and parks.The university is within easy reach of both New York City and Philadelphia, with the \u201cDinky\u201d shuttle train providing a regular service lasting about one hour to both cities. Princeton regularly subsidises many student trips to concerts, plays and athletic events in the two cities.",

Currently, Stanford is also one of the leading producers of US Congress members.The alumni include 30 living billionaires, 17 astronauts, 18 Turing Award recipients and two Fields Medallists.Google\u2019s co-founders met at Stanford while pursuing doctorate degrees, although neither ultimately completed their theses.In total, companies founded by Stanford affiliates and alumni generate more than $2.7 trillion annual revenue, which would be the 10th\u00a0largest economy in the world. These companies include Nike, Netflix, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, Instagram, Snapchat, PayPal and Yahoo.The first American woman to go into space, Sally Ride, received an undergraduate degree in physics from Stanford in 1973. Just 10 years later, she made her ascent into space.In the five years leading up to 2012, the university embarked on a challenge to raise more than $4 billion. The fundraising exceeded this target and concluded the campaign having raised $6.2 billion, which will be used for more faculty appointments, graduate research fellowships and scholarships, and construction on 38 new or existing campus buildings.Some of the funds have already been used for large projects, including the world\u2019s largest dedicated stem cell research facility, a new business school campus, a law school expansion, a new Engineering Quad, a campus concert hall and an art museum.Unofficially, the Stanford motto is a German quotation \u201cDie Luft der Freiheit weht\u201d, which translates as \u201cthe wind of freedom blows\u201d.",

Recent winners include Saul Perlmutter, who won the 2011 Nobel Prize for Physics for leading a team that discovered the accelerating expansion of the universe, suggesting the existence of a form of dark energy that comprises 75 per cent of the universe; and George Akerlof, who won the 2001 Prize for Economics for demonstrating how markets malfunction when buyers and sellers have access to different information.Notable alumni include novelist and journalist Jack London, Oscar-winning actor Gregory Peck, former prime minister and president of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, author Joan Didion and Women\u2019s World Cup-winning US footballer Alex Morgan.Berkeley has a tradition as a centre of political activism. During the 1960s and 1970s, the campus was a hotbed for student protests against the Vietnam War.Attractions on campus include a Botanic Garden established in 1890 and the 60,000-capacity California Memorial Stadium used by the university\u2019s sports teams.The Golden Bear is the symbol of Berkeley\u2019s sports teams.Berkeley\u2019s sporting prowess was demonstrated at the 2012 Olympics in London, when its graduates won 17 medals - 11 gold, one silver and five bronze. If Berkeley had been a country, it would have ranked joint sixth in the gold medal table, alongside France and Germany.",

Students also receive instruction in writing skills, quantitative reasoning and foreign languages.Unusually for the US, Yale students are housed in residential colleges on the model of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge. There are 12 historic colleges, and construction of two more started in 2014.Around one in five students is international, and more than half of all undergraduates receive scholarships or grants from the university.Yale has an endowment that exceeds $25 billion (\u00a317.3 billion), making it the second-richest educational institution in the world, and a library that holds more than 15 million volumes, making it the third-largest in the US.Yale alumni and sports teams are known as \u201cBulldogs\u201d, and many Yale graduates have gone on to notable careers in politics, the arts and science.Four Yale graduates signed the American Declaration of Independence, and the university has educated five US presidents: William Howard Taft, Gerald Ford, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Twenty Yale alumni have won Nobel prizes, including economist Paul Krugman, while 32 have won the Pulitzer Prize.Other notable alumni include US secretaries of state Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, and actress Meryl Streep.Yale\u2019s campus includes many famous buildings, such as the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the Sterling Memorial Library.New Haven is a city of about 130,000 people, located two and a half hours south of Boston, and an hour and a half north of New York.

A $600,000 pledge from oil magnate John D. Rockefeller helped to get the university off the ground, while local department store owner Marshall Field donated land. The vision of the university\u2019s first president was of a \u201cbran splinter new\u201d institution \u201cas solid as the ancient hills\u201d - a modern research university with a commitment to equal opportunities and non-sectarianism.This vision has been at the core of Chicago\u2019s existence, enshrined in its motto: Crescat scientia; vita excolatur (\u201cLet knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched\u201d). The university has lived up to this by being at the forefront of major academic endeavour and discovery. It has connections to more than 80 Nobel laureates, 30 National Medal winners (across humanities, arts and science) and nine Fields Medallists. It has also been awarded nearly 50 MacArthur \u201cgenius grants\u201d.Current faculty who have won a Nobel prize while at Chicago include economists Robert E. Lucas (1995), James J. Heckman (2000), Roger Myerson (2007), Lars Peter Hansen (2013), Eugene Fama (2013), and physicist James Cronin (1980). Ng\u00f4 Bao Ch\u00e2u, the first Vietnamese to win the Fields Medal (2010), is the Francis and Rose Yuen distinguished service professor in Chicago\u2019s department of mathematics.Notable alumni of Chicago include authors Saul Bellow and Susan Sontag, astronomer Edwin Hubble, film critic Roger Ebert, and everyone\u2019s favourite celluloid academic and archaeologist, Indiana Jones - who also taught at the university.While Chicago routinely ranks in the world\u2019s top institutions academically, its prowess extends to the sporting arena. It was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference, the oldest, highest-level intercollegiate athletics conference in the US. Today the university sponsors 19 intercollegiate sports, which cater for more than 500 participants and 330 competitions taking place each year. They all play under the same name, \u201cthe Maroons\u201d, which the university was nicknamed on account of its official colour.The university\u2019s campus sprawls over more than 210 acres in the Hyde Park and Woodlawn neighbourhoods, which lie south of downtown Chicago. Its first buildings were modelled on the Gothic style of the University of Oxford, but by the mid-20th century, modern buildings had begun popping up to intersperse old and new. It now blends a mix of classical and contemporary architecture from the Mitchell Tower and Robie House, architect Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s historic residence, through to the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle.The city of Chicago itself is the university\u2019s \u201claboratory, playground, and muse\u201d, with downtown highlights encompassing restaurants, shopping and cultural attractions. In one day you could visit the Navy Pier amusement park, the Art Institute of Chicago or shop on the Magnificent Mile.With satellite campuses and facilities overseas, UChicago has transcended its US geography to make itself an international institution. It invites prospective students to step inside its walls and \u201cwalk along the paths of Nobel laureates, pathbreaking researchers, and tomorrow\u2019s leaders\u201d.",

        "Description": "Given its status as one of the nine original Colonial Colleges - institutions established before the US became a sovereign nation after the American Revolution - and a founding member of the Association of American Universities, it is no surprise the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) claims to be the first fully fledged (multi-faculty) \u201cuniversity\u201d in the USA.Though Penn\u2019s origins date back to 1740, it was until 1749 when Benjamin Franklin published his famous essay,Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth, circulated it among Philadelphia\u2019s prominent citizens, and organized 24 trustees to form an institution of higher education based on his proposals. It was 30 years later when Penn was granted university status. Since then, Penn has expanded into a sprawling 302-acre campus with 200 buildings. It boasts many notable \u201cfirst\u201d landmarks on campus including the country\u2019s first student union, double-decker college football stadium, and the world\u2019s first collegiate business school - The Wharton School.Penn\u2019s prowess is not restricted to just infrastructure. The university has an exhaustive list of notable alumni from all walks of life. Penn has affiliations with over 25 Nobel Laureates including physicist Raymond Davis Jr and economist Lawrence Klein, and has accounted for numerous heads of state. Ninth president of the USA, William Henry Harrison, trod the boards at Penn in 1791, while Nnamdi Azikiwe - former president of Nigeria - and Kwame Nkrumah - former prime minister and president of Ghana - both gained multiple degrees from the institution. Noted modernist poets and friends Ezra Pound and William Carlos Williams are among the literary luminaries from the institution.",

The faculty provide more than 5,000 courses annually, with two-thirds of undergraduate classes having fewer than 30 students.For many freshmen, the undergraduate experience begins with a year-long Cluster Course, a team-taught exploration of a challenging interdisciplinary topic.In addition, 200 Fiat Lux Seminars are offered, taught by senior faculty in small-group settings in which freshmen have priority enrolment. Undergraduate research projects are available as early as freshman year, and more than half of UCLA students graduate with research experience in the humanities, social sciences, or STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) disciplines.UCLA also encourages students to study abroad - more than 2,400 do so each year - with more than 275 programmes in 39 countries.Community service is also a cornerstone of undergraduate education at UCLA. Students can participate through programmes at the Volunteer Center - with more than 220 student groups engaged in community service - as well as on Volunteer Day, which brings together 8,000 UCLA volunteers annually.For more activities outside the classroom, UCLA offers 1,000 student organisations providing students with ample opportunity to pursue interests and projects with fellow students.

A federal land grant university with a private endowment, Cornell has six locations across the world. Its main campus in Ithaca, New York State, covers 2,300 acres of the Finger Lakes region, and is so extensive that students can go hiking without even leaving the university.It also has a graduate school of medical sciences in New York city, a base in Rome where students study art, architecture and urban planning, a centre for students to gain work experience in Washington DC, and a medical college at Education City in Doha, Qatar.Cornell counts 45 Nobel laureates among its faculty members and alumni. Other notable alumni include Tsai Ing-wen, the president-elect of Taiwan, and Huey Lewis, frontman for the band Huey Lewis and the News.The university boasts a number of unique student traditions, such as Dragon Day, when, in late March each year, a huge dragon is paraded across campus by first-year students of the College of Architecture, Art and Planning. Heckled by rival students from the College of Engineering, the dragon is then burned in Cornell\u2019s Arts Quad. This ritual can be traced back to high jinx of the architecture class of 1901, and was formalised by students in the 1950s.Another tradition that has continued since Cornell\u2019s opening in 1868 is the Cornell Chimes - daily bell performances by \u201cchimesmasters\u201d. These performers are selected by rigorous, 10 week long competitions, although chimesmasters do not need to have any previous experience playing the chimes. After climbing the 161 steps to the top of the historic McGraw Tower where the bells are housed, chimesmasters play from a collection of more than 2,500 songs, from musicians ranging from Schubert to the Beatles.",

At its campus in Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, cows owned by the faculty once grazed, and as late as 1845, wheat was grown on site as part of a janitor\u2019s remuneration.By 1866, the university had become the largest in the country. Now, the University of Michigan is one of the biggest research universities in the United States. It boasts alumni including Gerald Ford, former US president; Larry Page, co-founder of Google; and actor James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader.The university\u2019s sporting tradition began in 1865, and its sports teams, collectively known as the Michigan Wolverines, have won more than 50 national championships in 12 sports. Why the wolverine became the university\u2019s mascot is a mystery, as although the nickname caught on in the middle of the 19th century, the first verified sighting of the animal in Michigan state did not occur until 2004.Michigan\u2019s mission is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through \u201cpreeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future\u201d. It offers 250 undergraduate majors, 100 doctoral and 200 master\u2019s programmes, as well as more than 1,400 student clubs.The university has no shortage of bizarre traditions. On campus sits \u201cThe Cube\u201d, a huge black object so finely balanced on one corner that students can spin it around despite its great weight. One myth is that the president gives it a push each morning in order to keep the campus running smoothly.When students first arrive at Michigan they walk through a campus fountain to make them an \u201cofficial wolverine\u201d. After graduation, they walk the other way through the water, signifying their departure to join the professional world. And don\u2019t step on the brass \u201cM\u201d at the centre of the campus, or exam failure awaits.",

In 1967 it merged with the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research, resulting in its present incarnation.CMU emphasises close collaborations between faculty and students to address scientific, technological and societal challenges, as well as making things \u2018from art to robots\u2019.The university lays claim to many examples of ground-breaking inventions and pioneering research into brain science, data, start-ups and driverless cars, among others. It was the first institution (via professor Scott Fahlman in 1982) to create a \u2018smile\u2019 in an email.Its cohort numbers well over 13,000 students from 114 countries, and a faculty of more than 1,400.With its strong focus on creating new things, CMS says that many of its students go on to join some of the world\u2019s most successful companies. The Association of University Technology Managers has ranked it first among US institutions for start-up companies created per research dollar spent, between 2008 and 2012.As well as its US locations in Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley, Carnegie Mellon has a campus in Doha, Qatar, and offers degree programmes in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and Latin America.CMU boasts many student traditions with a distinctly Scottish flavour that owe their heritage to\u00a0its Scottish-American founder, Andrew Carnegie. They include celebratory bagpipe playing on campus and the kilt-wearing student marching band known as the \u2018Band Without Pants.\u2019The university has been home to a total of 19 Nobel Laureates and is the recipient of a vast array of other prestigious awards.",

In the 2015 entry class, the most popular majors were public policy, economics, biology, biomedical engineering and psychology.Sports and performance art both thrive at Duke University, which competes in athletics and basketball, and hosts more than 60 art events a year.In 2014, Duke Kunshan University opened in China, with the aim of integrating liberal arts education with Chinese tradition. Duke also has a partnership with the National University of Singapore to collaborate on a joint medical programme, which took its first students in 2007.Overall, the university is one of the most competitive to get into. For the \u201cClass of 2019\u201d cohort, only 11.4 per cent of the applicants received a place.Unusually, the university requires undergraduates to live on campus for the first three years. More than 75 per cent of the students also pursue volunteering opportunities, supporting the university\u2019s mission, \u201cknowledge in service to society\u201d.The most notable alumnus is Richard Nixon, the 37th\u00a0president of the United States. He graduated from Duke University with a law degree in 1937. Duke alumni also head many Fortune 500 companies including Apple, Cisco Systems, JPMorgan Chase and PepsiCo.Melinda Gates, who co-founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with her husband, also attended the university.The alumni community also includes prominent novelists such as William Styron, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novelThe Confessions of Nat Turnerand also wroteSophie\u2019s Choice, and Anne Tyler, who received the Pulitzer Prize forBreathing Lessons.The university has an extensive private research library network, with three libraries on its West Campus, two on its East Campus, a library at the marine laboratory and separate libraries for business, divinity, law and medicine.",

These were all male, but women have been admitted since 1869.Northwestern owes its existence to the vision of its nine founders who, with no land, limited finances and little knowledge of higher education, determined to create a university for the vast Northwest Territory covering more than five of today\u2019s states. They began planning in 1850 and, three years later, boldly went ahead and purchased a 379-acre site close to Lake Michigan and developed the campus at Evanston, named after a founder called John Evans.From these small beginnings, Northwestern has developed into a leading private research university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence. It now consists of 12 separate schools and colleges and is notable for its research strength in fields including neuroscience, nanotechnology, biotechnology and the development of new drugs.\u00a0The main campus is still based at Evanston, 10 miles north of Chicago, although there is a smaller one in Chicago, so students enjoy all the stimulus and opportunities for personal and professional development provided by one of the world\u2019s great cities. Since 2008, there has also been a third, satellite campus in Doha, Qatar.Northwestern\u2019s mascot is Willy the Wildcat. Its mottoes are both taken from the New Testament and read, in Latin and Greek, \u201cWhatsoever things are true\u201d and \u201cThe world is full of grace and truth\u201d.Celebrated alumni include novelist Saul Bellow and economist George Stigler, who both went on to win Nobel Prizes, as well as Friends star David Schwimmer,Gone Girlauthor Gillian Flynn, and George R. R. Martin, whose novels inspired the Game of Thrones television series. No fewer than four economists and one chemist who worked as faculty at Northwestern went to receive Nobel Prizes. And the diplomat and political scientist Ralph Bunce, who had been a researcher there, went on to become the first African American to win a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict.",

        "Location": "Rhode Island, United States",
        "Description": "Founded in 1764, Brown is the seventh oldest university in the United States, and one of its most renowned higher education institutions. It is part of the Ivy League and, as an institution that prides itself on openness, was the first of the members to accept students from all religious affiliations.Originally called the College of Rhode Island, Brown\u2019s first home was Warren, Rhode Island before it relocated to College Hill, overlooking the state\u2019s capital city Providence, in 1770. Some 34 years later, in recognition of a $5,000 gift from alumnus and leading Providence businessman Nicholas Brown, the university was renamed to reflect today\u2019s title.Today\u2019s picturesque campus is made up of 230 buildings over 150 acres within walking distance of downtown Providence and close to the lively Thayer Street, Wickenden Street and Wayland Square where students and local residents mix, among ample shopping, dining and entertainment.The university\u2019s sports teams play under the name of the \u201cBrown Bears\u201d. Theodore Francis Green, a former Rhode Island governor and US senator, introduced a brown bear as the university\u2019s mascot. Today, Bruno the Brown bear is still the university\u2019s prime cheerleader.A defining characteristic of the university was its introduction of the \u201cBrown Curriculum\u201d, which altered undergraduate education immeasurably at the institution. It was inspired by Francis Wyland, Brown\u2019s fourth president, who argued that a student should have the freedom to \u201cstudy what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose\u201d. The new \u201cOpen Curriculum\u201d, which was launched in 1970, allowed students to develop their own core curriculum rather than be bound to a prescribed \u201cliberal arts education\u201d. It has defined Brown\u2019s undergraduate experience to this day.Besides study, Brown is a leading research institution. The university has connections to seven Nobel laureates including alumni Craig C. Mello and Jerry White who won for physiology or medicine and peace respectively, and current physics faculty member Leon Cooper. Fields Medal winner David Mumford is emeritus professor of applied mathematics at the university.Brown\u2019s diverse student body is exemplified by notable alumni from all walks of life. From the father of American education Horace Mann and The Office star John Krasinski, to Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark and financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, the university\u2019s people are varied. Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films, graduated from Brown in 2014, having transferred from the University of Oxford.",

Where discovery pulls from every practice and profession. Where the most comprehensive solutions come from the most diverse minds. We were founded in 1908 to serve California. Today, we\u2019re confronting the world\u2019s most urgent challenges\u2014especially those related to food, health, the environment and society.Our 5,300-acre campus borders the city of Davis, a compact and vibrant college town. Sacramento is 20 minutes away, and world-famous destinations such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Lake Tahoe and Napa Valley are within a two-hour drive.UC Davis is the most inclusive campus in the University of California system, with four colleges and six professional schools that offer over a hundred majors and nearly a hundred graduate and professional degrees. UC Davis enrolls about 39,000 annually, including international students from more than 110 countries. In the 2021-22 fiscal year, the university joined the exclusive group of fewer than 20 public universities in the nation surpassing $1 billion in research funding. The university also contributes over $8 billion to the California economy each year.Our geographic footprint goes well beyond the city of Davis. The UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento is among the nation\u2019s Top 50 hospitals in 10 medical specialties from cardiology to cancer. We also operate an environmental research center on Lake Tahoe, a marine laboratory at Bodega Bay and an MBA program in the San Francisco Bay Area.",

It comprises over 175 buildings spread across five, centrally-located campuses.The main Danforth Campus is the academic home to the majority of the university's undergraduate, graduate and professional students. The Washington University Medical Camous is home to the School of Medicine.Other WashU campuses include the site of a former St. Louis department store and another that comprises a 2,000-acre outdoor laboratory for learning and research.The university claims several areas of research focus including biotechnology, plant science and business development.With several strategic partnerships in place at global universities, WashU students have various opportunities to travel and study abroad. Among them are elective rotations for medical students in overseas clinics throughout Africa, Asia and South America, while law students can undertake internships in the Netherlands. The university also has a reciprocal student exchange programme with Fudan University in Shanghai, China.Around one-third of WashU\u2019s students engage in study abroad programs, 80 per cent of undergraduate students pursue multiple majors and/or minors, and about 60 per cent participate in community serviceA total of 26 Nobel Laureates have been affiliated with WashU over the years, and its alumni includes 11 Pulitzer Prize winners, four Poet Laureates of the United States and 15 recipients of the National Medal of Science.The university\u2019s motto, Per Veritatem Vis, translates as \u2018Strength through Truth.\u2019",

Hershey Medical Center, which treats more than 1 million patients every year.The institution also operates Penn State World Campus, allowing students from around the world to study for the university\u2019s qualifications online.All this is a far cry from Penn State\u2019s humble beginnings in 1855, when it was founded as the Farmers\u2019 High School of Pennsylvania.The institution gradually diversified its offering but did not gain university status in 1953, a move which was followed by a tripling of student numbers.The university\u2019s mascot is the Nittany Lion - referring to the mountain lions which are thought to have once roamed nearby Mount Nittany - and alumni take the same name.Penn State is also home to the world\u2019s largest student-run fundraising event, the Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, which sees dancers strut their stuff around the clock over the course of a weekend, raising millions of dollars for charity.",

Its alumni reach is over 540,000 strong, spread all over the world.MSU is a multi-disciplinary research institution and this is reflected in its diverse range of accolades. Alfred D. Hershey, who took his undergraduate and doctoral degrees at MSU, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969, while one of the world\u2019s greatest ever basketball players Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson was a keen student at the university before being drafted by the NBA. MSU\u2019s College of Communication Arts and Sciences has a particularly rich history, cultivating eight Pulitzer Prize winners. Richard Ford, another Pulitzer Prize winner for his novelIndependence Day, also studied at MSU.MSU students are dubbed \u2018Spartans\u2019 when they enter the institution and the university\u2019s large sports programme, which has 25 varsity squads.",

        "Description": "The University of Florida can trace its origins back to the very start of publicly funded higher education in the state. In 1853, shortly after Governor Thomas Brown passed a bill offering financial support, a man called Gilbert Kingsbury opened the East Florida Seminary. This eventually merged with the former Florida Agricultural College, the St Petersburg Normal and Industrial School and the South Florida Military College in 1905 to become the new University of the State of Florida. The relevant legislation was known as the Buckman Act and its originator, Henry Holland Buckman, is honoured in the university\u2019s Buckman Hall.Major developments soon followed. In 1906, the Florida Museum of Natural History was incorporated into UF. As well as being invaluable for teaching and research, this represented a commitment to the study of biological diversity still significant almost a century later in 2000, when the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity was established as one of the largest collections of butterflies and moths in the world. In 1909, president Albert Murphree reorganised the separate colleges under a single mission and greatly expanded the size of the institution, with an annual intake rising from 200 to over 2,000.Major developments in the 20th century include the creation of the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing in 1956 and a teaching hospital two years later. By building on these, UF is now the only university in the country which incorporates six different healthcare colleges on a single campus. A different landmark was reached in 1968, when the first ever \u201cGator\u201d took part in the Olympics.Since the millennium, the university has remained at the forefront of research in many areas, often through high-profile international collaborations. In 2002, it led a consortium of seven universities which secured a $15 million grant from NASA to carry out space research. From 2008, a partnership with Zhejiang University in China worked on sustainable energy. In 2012, over 30 UF physicists, postdocs and students played a leading part in the team whose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider established that the elusive Higgs boson really existed. The university continues to work with Spain on the world\u2019s largest single-aperture optical telescope.In 2014, the total number of students who had graduated from UF reached half a million. Notable alumni include actress Faye Dunaway, astronaut Kevin Ford and senior senator of Florida Marco Rubio.",

        "Description": "The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) is a well-known research-based higher education institution that currently operates under the umbrella of the University of California system. The university has been consistently highly ranked among similar research institutions both inside and outside the US.The idea for the establishment of the university came as a direct result of a bid to the governing board of the University of California system to equip Santa Cruz with a competitive public institution of higher education.Opened in the fall of 1965, the university is committed to equipping students with the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge in their chosen academic discipline. With over 60 undergraduate and 40 graduate degree programs, UCSC has developed itself as an arena for interdisciplinary education and research opportunities in\u00a0arts,\u00a0engineering,\u00a0humanities,\u00a0physical and biological sciences, and\u00a0social sciences.Covering over 810 hectares of land surrounded by Santa Cruz Mountains, the main university campus hosts 10 residential colleges, and the modern McHenry library, gathering publications related to arts, humanities and social sciences.Alongside their work on campus, scholars are also encouraged to benefit from the university\u2019s strong connections and complete work experience in the industry. Alternatively, students can choose to complete a yearlong exchange programme with a partner university, such as the University of New Mexico or the University of New Hampshire.The university attempts to act as a driver of change in the local area, encouraging sustainability initiatives which are an integral part of life on campus. UCSC has made a considerable effort related to preservation of local water resources, traffic reduction and recycling, and was able to achieve a notable reduction in traffic congestion locally, among other things.Famous people to name UCSC as their alma-mater include film director Cary Fukunaga and CEO of Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post, Jonah Peretti.",

        "Description": "The University of Notre Dame is located in the US state of Indiana. Founded in 1842 by Reverend Edward F. Sorin, a priest of the French missionary order known as the Congregation of the Holy Cross, it was established with the aim of being one of America\u2019s great Catholic universities.Priests of the Holy Cross governed the university until 1967, when it shifted into a two-tiered system of governance made up of both lay and religious trustees and fellows. While remaining true to its religious roots and traditions, it now claims to be \u201cdedicated to religious belief no less than scientific fact\u201d and stands for \u201cvalues in a world of facts\u201d.Today, the private, coeducational research institution offers 67 undergraduate studies degree programmes within four colleges. These are the College of Arts and Letters, College of Science, Mendoza College of Business, and the College of Engineering. In addition, it is home to the School of Architecture, the First Year of Studies, and the Graduate School, Notre Dame serves around 12,000 students in all.Its Graduate School was established in 1918 and is made up of four divisions: Engineering, Humanities, Science, and Social Science. Comprising 30 departments and serving over 2,000 students, it offers 26 doctoral degree programmes, 11 masters\u2019 degrees, and four professional masters\u2019 degrees. Around 97 per cent of students in the Graduate School receive full-tuition scholarships.The university campus is spread across 1,261 acres and houses 171 buildings at a value of roughly $3.3 billion. The university\u2019s operating budget is more than $1.5 billion with an endowment valued at close to $10 billion. Its expenditure from outside sources and research awards exceeds \u00a3130 million. The majority of this is federal government funding, while the remainder comes from industrial, foundation and other sponsors.In international terms, Notre Dame attracts over 1,100 students from nearly 90 countries worldwide. As well as this, within its various academic departments, it hosts more than 350 international scholars annually.It is estimated that more than half of the university\u2019s undergraduate students embark on a year abroad during their time there. Destinations for study include countries from Australia to Brazil, China to France, Israel to Uganda, and many more in between.Adding to the university\u2019s international status, is its network of six \u2018Global Gateways\u2019 for academic and cultural exchange, located in Beijing, Chicago, Dublin, Jerusalem, London and Rome.",

It was George Washington himself who envisioned a university in the United States capital in his last will and testament, to serve as an intellectual hub for the entire country.It boasts three campuses - Foggy Bottom, Mount Vernon and the Virginia Science and Technology campus - so close to the heart of power that parts of the university are just a four-block walk to the White House, not to mention many other governmental and private agencies, providing huge internship and job opportunities for students.The university\u2019s graduates have helped shape US history: it counts five Supreme Court justices among its alumni. Politicians Colin Powell and John Foster Dulles, as well as former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and former first lady Jackie Kennedy also went to George Washington.George Washington was the backdrop to several momentous events in 20th-century history. In 1939, a conference on campus revealed that Otto Hahn had successfully split the atom; while in 1981, the university hospital treated Ronald Reagan after an attempted assassination.But the university is not just about politics. George Washington boasts a thriving arts scene, with several student dance groups, improvisation and theatre clubs, art galleries, as well as instrumental and voice ensembles.The university\u2019s Lisner Auditorium has hosted appearances ranging from Betty White and Al Gore to Salman Rushdie. It has a wide range of fine art, music, theatre and dance scholarships on offer to freshmen.Based in Washington, students have access to some of the finest libraries, museums and arts venues in the country. It also has a strong athletic tradition, stretching back to the late 19th century.The university launched collegiate basketball in 1906, just as the sport was in its infancy. George Washington also has an impressive record in soccer, baseball and athletics.There are no fewer than six busts of George Washington himself on campus, and the university colours of buff and blue are those the general wore into battle.It has two mascots: an official namesake mascot called George, completed with powdered wig and tricorne hat; and an unofficial hippo mascot, which appears around campus and at events.",

        "Description": "The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) is the city\u2019s only public research university. It grew out of the Chicago College of Pharmacy, founded in 1859, after which it joined forces with other medical colleges in the region.Although UIC\u2019s origins are rooted in healthcare - the university lays claim to the largest medical school in the US - its 15 colleges offer programmes spanning liberal arts, social work and engineering, as well as sciences and health.The institution now comprises over 29,000 students and is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse student bodies in America.UIC\u2019s first campus, at the junction of the Greektown and Little Italy districts of Chicago, meant that many students were the first in their families to attend college (and still remain so, to this day).During a period of rapid student expansion in the 1960s, the renowned Chicago architect Walter Netsch was asked to design buildings that would accommodate a growing student community in what was a small area of land. His response was to construct them in a series of concentric rings, the inspiration for which was a droplet of water.Netsch\u2019s brutalist style dominates UIC\u2019s east campus, which is nicknamed \u2018Circle\u2019 after the major expressway that runs alongside it.Extra-curricular activities at UIC are in plentiful supply. Sports facilities include a gym, volleyball and racquetball courts, running paths, climbing walls and an outdoor field complex comprising 214,000 square feet of synthetic turf for soccer and baseball games. A separate outdoor facility has tennis and basketball courts, along with swimming pools, saunas and a wellness centre.At the beginning of each academic year, UIC also hosts a free \u2018back to school\u2019 music festival on campus exclusively for students. A 10,000-seater, multi-purpose arena on campus allows for easy access to other major concerts and productions, while a contemporary art space, called Gallery 400, is at the centre of the Chicago arts scene.Away from campus, UIC students have the opportunity to take part in one of the university\u2019s many study abroad programmes that include, among other things, interning at the German Bundestag and working for\u00a0a member of the German Parliament.",

        "Description": "The Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) was founded after the minister Frank Wakely Gunsaulus gave a sermon saying if he had $1 million he would use it to found a Chicago school where students from all backgrounds, not just the wealthy, would be able to receive an education that would make them useful contributing members of society.Gunsaulus sermon inspired Philip Danforth Armour, Sr. an industrialist who had made a fortune in the meatpacking industry selling food to the US army. Armour donated $1 million and the Armour Institute was established. IIT was founded in 1940 when the Armour Institute merged with the Lewis Institute. The liberal arts programs on offer at the Lewis Institute complemented the engineering and science-based teaching available at Armour.Today IIT is a private research university, focused on technology, which caters to around 8,000 students studying a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses in engineering, science, architecture, business, design, human sciences, applied technology, and law. The university is also highly international with a large proportion graduate students coming from abroad and many undergraduates classified as international.IIT has five separate campuses in the Chicago area, the main one is Mies Campus, which covers 120 acres, and has been named a National Historic Landmark due to its beautiful design and architecture. Mies is also home to residential halls, fraternity and sorority houses and student sports and leisure facilities. The Downtown Campus building houses the colleges of law and business.",

The other four campuses can be found across the state in Wilmington, Dover, Georgetown and Lewes.The library collection includes nearly three million books and bound periodicals as well as over 500,000 electronic books and journals. In addition to this, it is a depository for US government publications, meaning they are accessible to the public for free.Much to the benefit of its College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, the university has its own 146-foot vessel called the Hugh R. Sharp. Named after a previous trustee of the university who had a passion for marine studies, the research vessel is the most advanced in the US and can carry up to 20 scientists on coastal research cruises of up to 18 days.Back on land, the university also has its own High Performance Figure Skating Centre where some of the best figure skaters in the world flock to train.Included among its alumni are three signatories of the Declaration of Independence and one of the US Constitution, all from the university\u2019s first intake. Today, its 160,000-strong alumni of \u2018living Blue Hens\u2019 (named after the university\u2019s sports teams) include Nobel prize winners, Guggenheim and Fulbright fellows and members of various prominent scientific bodies such as the National Academy of Sciences.The Carnegie Foundation has classified the University of Delaware as a research university.",

        "Description": "Colorado School of Mines (Mines) is a public research university specialising in science and engineering, located in the city of Golden, Colorado, just 15 miles\u00a0from Denver\u2019s downtown business district.Established in 1859, it mainly acted as a supply centre for local miners and settlers (the then \u2018Golden City\u2019 was a gold-rush town, populated by prospectors). By 1866, a local bishop, George M Randall, had recognised the need to bring higher education to the region and set to work constructing a university that would include a school of mines.When Mines opened in 1874, the focus of its early academic programmes was on gold and silver, and their extraction. Students could take courses in chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, mining engineering, geology, botany, drawing and maths.Today, Mines priortises \u2018understanding the Earth, harnessing energy and sustaining the environment\u2019 with a science and engineering curriculum that emphasises \u2018responsible stewardship of the earth and its resources.\u2019The university\u2019s campus is home to both award-winning modern buildings and historical architecture\u00a0restored to its former glory. Among them is the Mines\u2019 Geology Museum, founded in 1874, which exhibits mineral, gemstone, fossil, meteorite and historic mining artefacts from the 19th century.Located in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, Golden itself offers easy access to stunning scenery and a range of outdoor sports. Cultural attractions come in the form of art galleries and museums: it boasts the most per capita within the whole of Colorado.Golden is also home to the headquarters of Coors Beer and its brewery acts as a local tourist attraction, as well as being one of the leading employers in the area.On the athletics field, Mines\u2019 students are nicknamed the Orediggers and their sports teams\u2019 colours are silver and blue.",

Steven\u2019s decision to leave enough in his will to finance the establishment of a university.SIT has four academic schools: the School of Business, the School of Systems & Enterprises, the College of Arts and Letters and the Charles V. Schaefer Jr. School of Engineering and Science.All schools are located on the Hoboken campus, along with several halls of residence, restaurants and sports facilities. The small city of Hoboken provides a comfortable learning environment while the bright lights of New York are only a short journey away.As well as a host of research institutes, SIT also maintains three national research Centres of Excellence. The Maritime Security Centre investigates port and maritime security, while the Systems Engineering Research Centre is affiliated with the US Department of Defence. The final Centre of Excellence is the Atlantic Centre for the Innovative Design and Control of Small Ships, which combines engineering disciplines and shipbuilding.Some hugely influential people have studied at SIT over the years. Co-founder of General Motors, Charles Stewart Mott, graduated from SIT in 1897, while Alfred Fielding, co-inventor of bubble wrap, also studied there.Frederick Reines, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1995 received a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degree from SIT.",

        "Description": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln was established in 1869, two years after the state of Nebraska became part of the United States. In the 1890s, a law school and graduate school were founded - the latter being the first of its kind west of the Mississippi River. In 1896, it also awarded its first doctorate degrees, again making it one of the first of its kind west of the Mississippi. The campuses have botanical gardens and arboreta, a hallmark of UNL as the birthplace of ecology.Today UNL has 10 colleges that cover science and the humanities. Its primary area of focus is undergraduate education. It runs several programmes that reflect this, such as \u00a0the Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences Program (UCARE), which allows students and staff to work together on project, and the Jeffrey S.

        "Description": "The University of South Carolina is one of the oldest and most comprehensive public institutions of higher education in the US, with its main campus in the state capital, Columbia.The flagship campus offers more than 320 degrees at bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s and doctoral level, and educates more than 30,000 students on a 360-acre site.The Columbia campus is divided into 15 different schools and colleges, each reflecting different areas of research and educational expertise. In addition, there is the South Carolina Honors College, which offers a liberal arts-style education in a state university setting.USC has seven satellite campuses, which offer a range of degrees and qualifications. It also runs an innovation district called Innovista, looking to commercialise research in key areas of strength such as biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental science and alternative fuels.The history of the university stretches back to 1801, when South Carolina College was established as part of the Southern public college movement which was encouraged by Thomas Jefferson.The institution flourished in the decades prior to the American Civil War, with the historic horseshoe-shaped campus district which still stands today taking shape during this era.But the war had a devastating impact on the institution, forcing its closure in 1863 as students volunteered for Confederate service.The institution was re-established in 1865 as the University of South Carolina, and led the way on racial integration for a time, enrolling its first black students in 1873 - the only southern state university to do so.However, funding shortages forced the closure of the university again in 1877, and it reopened three years later as an all-white agricultural college. Black students were not admitted again until 1863.Nowadays, the Irvin department of rare books and special collections is home to the world\u2019s largest collection of works by Ernest Hemingway and the largest collection of Robert Burns works and associated Scottish literature outside Scotland.Alumni and sports teams at the institution are known as Gamecocks.Prominent USC alumni include former White House chief of staff Andrew Card and US senator Lindsey Graham. In addition, all four members of the band Hootie & the Blowfish attended USC.",

        "Description": "New Mexico State University is a land-grant research university and NASA space Grant CollegeIt was founded in 1888 as Las Cruces College. It became the first place of higher learning in New Mexico, which was still a US territory at the time.Situated in Las Cruces, or \"The City of the Crosses\" in the Mesilla Valley, the university\u2019s main 900-acre campus is located close to major geographical landmarks that include the Organ mountains and the White Sands National Monument, the world\u2019s largest dune field.At its inception, New Mexico state authorities called for the establishment of a faculty of agriculture that incorporated architecture and mechanical arts. To this day the university still works closely with the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, which is located on campus, with the university providing support for state residents in areas such as education, energy and water, farming, ranching and gardening.New Mexico State University is known as a Hispanic-serving institution with a student population that is 45 per cent Hispanic. It is renowned for its progressive approach towards diversity and first admitted an African-American woman to its student body in 1928, when many other universities in the US were several years away from doing the same.Five of the university\u2019s buildings were designed by the pioneering southwestern architect, Henry C Trost, in the early part of the 20th Century. They were built in what Trost called \"Spanish Renaissance architectural style\" in a horseshoe design, something he hoped would promote \u201can appearance of unity and harmony rarely found in like institutions\u201d.The university is also renowned for its courses in animation and game design, as well as animal sciences and conservation. It is the only institution in the state to offer a degree in professional golf management.Its alumni association dates from 1898 and comprises over 120,000 living members, including president of Skymall, Christine Aguilera, and Alvy Ray Smith, the co-founder of computer animation film studio, Pixar.",

In 1933, its graduate school became the University in Exile - a haven for scholars fleeing anti-intellectual regimes such as fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. For these reasons, as well as due to a conflict at Columbia University in New York, the school is associated with outstanding figures such as economist Thorstein Veblen, psychologist Erich Fromm, political philosopher Hannah Arendt and Leo Strauss and philosopher Hans Jonas.The New School\u2019s uniqueness comes from the combination between a world-famous design school - Parsons School of Design - with a highly regarded liberal arts college - Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts and College of Performing Arts as well as renowned graduate programmes.The university puts emphasis on the collaboration between journalists with designers, architects with social researchers, media specialists with activists, poets with musicians. The schools are based in New York City, Paris, Shanghai, and Mumbai.Its 135 undergraduate and graduate degree programmes cover art and design, social science, liberal arts, management and public policy, media, and performing arts. As a student, you have the freedom to design your own course and specialise later on. Courses available include Hip Hop: Skill, Style, Science, Origins of the Crisis in the Eurozone, Urban Environmental Health, Heterodox Identities, Punk and Noise, Games 101.Some outstanding alumni include fashion designer Donna Karan, actor Bradley Cooper, jazz drummer Ali Jackson, designer Marc Jacobs, Ana Oliveira, President of New York Women\u2019s Foundation, actor Marlon Brando (attended for one year), opera singer Frederica von Stade, Chief Creative Officer at Google Robert Wong, advertising executive Richard Silverstein and Jeanine Liburd, Executive Vice President at Black Entertainment Television.",

The merger, incorporating Southeastern\u2019s schools of Osteopathic Medicine, Pharmacy, Optometry and Allied Health, created an emphasis on medicine and associated disciplines still evident in 2019 in eight out of its 18 schools including the School of Allopathic Medicine, which opened in 2017.Most of the 20,793 students enrolled in 2019 were based at the 314 acre Davie Campus, next to Florida Atlantic University. There are seven satellite sites elsewhere in Florida, plus a Puerto Rico campus opened in 2014.In 2016 Times Higher Education listed it among 20 universities capable of becoming world-renowned by 2030 The university also garnered a lot of attention through its  \"Be Dominant\" branding, speaking of the \"NSU Edge\" and using images of sharks - the nickname of the university sports teams playing in NCAA Division II.There are notable research strengths in oceanography and coral reefs. In 2008 the university hosted one of the world\u2019s largest ever symposia on reefs, with representatives from 75 countries. A recurring $15m federal grant for work on reefs has been central to the work of the Centre for Excellence for Coral Reef Ecosystems Science Research, a $50m facility.The campus has hosted pre-season training for the Miami Dolphins National Football League team since 1993 and alumni include baseball player JD Martinez, a 2018 World Series winner with the Boston Red Sox.",

It is now the largest institution in the Texas State University System and is one of the top universities for producing Fulbright scholars in the US.Located between Austin and San Antonio, the 2km\u00b2 main campus is next to the headwaters of the spring-fed San Marcos River and its traditional architecture, rolling hills and giant oak and cypress trees make for an impressive setting.There is also a satellite campus, Texas State University Round Rock (RRC) that offers undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the wider north Austin area. Any student studying at the RRC will graduate with a degree from Texas State University.The most popular majors at TSU are psychology, management, marketing, elementary education, electrical engineering, journalism and mass communications, nursing, communication design, biology and criminal justice.TSU boasts the largest forensics research facility in the world and has one of the four body farms still existing in the US, allowing researchers to study decomposition in a range of different conditions. It is also is one of the best places to study aquatic species and ecosystems, on account of the spring that feeds the nearby San Marcos River. It is home to eight endangered species (including the Texas blind salamander).US President Lyndon B. Johnson is TSU\u2019s most notable alumnus (1926-30), who attended what was then known as the Southwest Texas State Teachers College. TSU remains the only Texas university to have graduated a US President.Texas State became a tobacco-free campus in 2011.There is a strong fraternity and sorority culture at TSU, and students can pick from over 300 student clubs and organisations. More Hispanic students are awarded bachelor\u2019s degrees at TSU than 97 per cent of American colleges and universities.",
