    "grammar_and_style": "The SOP is generally well-written, but there are some areas for improvement. There are a few grammatical errors, such as missing articles ('a', 'the') and incorrect use of commas. For example, 'in the 21st century, computer science will fundamentally change every industry and every one of us.' could be rephrased for better clarity. Some sentences are repetitive, e.g., 'I am confident in my ability to solve various theoretical problems during hands-on machine learning research.' is mentioned twice. The tone is mostly academic, but some sentences feel informal, such as 'I was surprised by the results, which implied a potential contradiction with the professor\u2019s proposed solution.' Consider rephrasing to 'The results revealed a potential contradiction with the professor's proposed solution, which surprised me.' Passive voice is occasionally used, e.g., 'I was responsible for collecting financial data and writing industry reports.' While not incorrect, consider varying sentence structure for better flow.",
    "structure": "The SOP follows a logical structure: introduction, academic background, professional experience, and conclusion. However, some sections feel disorganized or could be more clearly delineated. For instance, the transition from discussing undergraduate courses to computational thinking skills feels abrupt. Consider adding transitional phrases or sentences to connect ideas more smoothly. The conclusion feels somewhat repetitive, as it reiterates points already made. The SOP could benefit from a clearer separation between academic background and professional experience, possibly by dedicating more distinct sections to each.",
    "clarity_and_coherence": "The SOP is generally easy to follow, but some statements are vague or ambiguous. For example, 'I am looking forward to studying at University, where I can learn how to create web scrapers, manage databases, contribute to open-source projects, and research various advanced topics.' lacks specificity about how these activities align with the student's research interests or career goals. Similarly, 'I plan to continue to capitalize on the strength of my computational thinking skills at Columbia to manage complex databases, practice classic algorithms, and apply my computer science expertise to solve real-life problems.' could be more specific about what 'real-life problems' refer to. The SOP jumps between different ideas (e.g., from academic courses to internship experience), which sometimes disrupts the flow.",
    "research_interests_strength": "The SOP mentions an interest in machine learning and computational research, highlighting relevant coursework and an experience with a mathematical model. However, the research goals are not clearly articulated or specifically aligned with faculty or research projects at Columbia. For example, the student could mention specific professors at Columbia whose research aligns with their interests or describe a research project they would like to undertake. The connection between past experiences and future research interests feels somewhat tenuous. More specific examples or projects demonstrating research capabilities would strengthen the application.",
