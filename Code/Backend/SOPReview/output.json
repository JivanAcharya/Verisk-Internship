    "grammar_and_style": "The SOP is generally well-written, but there are some areas for improvement. There are a few grammatical errors, such as 'Thanks to my proficiency in both areas, I will be able to find statistical explanations for the algebraic approach as well as perform algebraic calculations for statistical models.' Consider rephrasing to 'With my proficiency in both areas, I can find statistical explanations for the algebraic approach and perform algebraic calculations for statistical models.' The sentence 'I am very passionate about studying CS because I know that CS will significantly impact my career and future life.' is a bit vague; consider making it more specific. There is also some repetition, such as the mention of computational thinking skills multiple times. The tone is mostly academic, but some sentences could be more formal.",
    "structure": "The SOP follows a logical structure, but some sections could be more clearly defined. The introduction effectively introduces the applicant's background and interest in CS. The academic background section is strong, with specific courses and skills mentioned. However, the professional experience section could be more detailed, and the connection to research interests could be clearer. The conclusion is a bit abrupt; consider summarizing the main points and reiterating interest in the program. There is no clear 'research interests' section, which could be a missed opportunity to showcase the applicant's research goals.",
    "clarity_and_coherence": "The SOP is generally easy to follow, but some sentences could be more concise. For example, 'Studying computer science is similar to hiking in some ways: as a non-CS major, I may find some CS courses challenging. However, with the patience and perseverance I have learned through hiking, I am able to overcome these challenges and master advanced computational techniques.' could be broken up for better clarity. Some statements, such as 'I am confident in my ability to solve various theoretical problems during hands-on machine learning research,' could be more specific. The transitions between paragraphs could be smoother.",
    "research_interests_strength": "The SOP mentions the applicant's interest in machine learning and computational research, but could be more specific. For example, what specific areas of machine learning interest the applicant? What research questions do they hope to explore? The SOP mentions Columbia University, but does not specify particular professors, labs, or projects that align with the applicant's research interests. Consider adding more details about how the applicant's research goals align with the program and faculty at Columbia.",
