A $600,000 pledge from oil magnate John D. Rockefeller helped to get the university off the ground, while local department store owner Marshall Field donated land. The vision of the university’s first president was of a “bran splinter new” institution “as solid as the ancient hills” – a modern research university with a commitment to equal opportunities and non-sectarianism.This vision has been at the core of Chicago’s existence, enshrined in its motto: Crescat scientia; vita excolatur (“Let knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched”). The university has lived up to this by being at the forefront of major academic endeavour and discovery. It has connections to more than 80 Nobel laureates, 30 National Medal winners (across humanities, arts and science) and nine Fields Medallists. It has also been awarded nearly 50 MacArthur “genius grants”.Current faculty who have won a Nobel prize while at Chicago include economists Robert E. Lucas (1995), James J. Heckman (2000), Roger Myerson (2007), Lars Peter Hansen (2013), Eugene Fama (2013), and physicist James Cronin (1980).

Its first buildings were modelled on the Gothic style of the University of Oxford, but by the mid-20th century, modern buildings had begun popping up to intersperse old and new. It now blends a mix of classical and contemporary architecture from the Mitchell Tower and Robie House, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s historic residence, through to the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle.The city of Chicago itself is the university’s “laboratory, playground, and muse”, with downtown highlights encompassing restaurants, shopping and cultural attractions. In one day you could visit the Navy Pier amusement park, the Art Institute of Chicago or shop on the Magnificent Mile.With satellite campuses and facilities overseas, UChicago has transcended its US geography to make itself an international institution.

At its campus in Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, cows owned by the faculty once grazed, and as late as 1845, wheat was grown on site as part of a janitor’s remuneration.By 1866, the university had become the largest in the country.

Why the wolverine became the university’s mascot is a mystery, as although the nickname caught on in the middle of the 19th century, the first verified sighting of the animal in Michigan state did not occur until 2004.Michigan’s mission is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through “preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future”.

Some 34 years later, in recognition of a $5,000 gift from alumnus and leading Providence businessman Nicholas Brown, the university was renamed to reflect today’s title.Today’s picturesque campus is made up of 230 buildings over 150 acres within walking distance of downtown Providence and close to the lively Thayer Street, Wickenden Street and Wayland Square where students and local residents mix, among ample shopping, dining and entertainment.The university’s sports teams play under the name of the “Brown Bears”.

In 1853, shortly after Governor Thomas Brown passed a bill offering financial support, a man called Gilbert Kingsbury opened the East Florida Seminary. This eventually merged with the former Florida Agricultural College, the St Petersburg Normal and Industrial School and the South Florida Military College in 1905 to become the new University of the State of Florida. The relevant legislation was known as the Buckman Act and its originator, Henry Holland Buckman, is honoured in the university’s Buckman Hall.Major developments soon followed. In 1906, the Florida Museum of Natural History was incorporated into UF. As well as being invaluable for teaching and research, this represented a commitment to the study of biological diversity still significant almost a century later in 2000, when the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity was established as one of the largest collections of butterflies and moths in the world. In 1909, president Albert Murphree reorganised the separate colleges under a single mission and greatly expanded the size of the institution, with an annual intake rising from 200 to over 2,000.Major developments in the 20th century include the creation of the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing in 1956 and a teaching hospital two years later. By building on these, UF is now the only university in the country which incorporates six different healthcare colleges on a single campus. A different landmark was reached in 1968, when the first ever “Gator” took part in the Olympics.Since the millennium, the university has remained at the forefront of research in many areas, often through high-profile international collaborations. In 2002, it led a consortium of seven universities which secured a $15 million grant from NASA to carry out space research. From 2008, a partnership with Zhejiang University in China worked on sustainable energy. In 2012, over 30 UF physicists, postdocs and students played a leading part in the team whose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider established that the elusive Higgs boson really existed.
