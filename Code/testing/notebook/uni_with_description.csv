A $600,000 pledge from oil magnate John D. Rockefeller helped to get the university off the ground, while local department store owner Marshall Field donated land. The vision of the university’s first president was of a “bran splinter new” institution “as solid as the ancient hills” – a modern research university with a commitment to equal opportunities and non-sectarianism.This vision has been at the core of Chicago’s existence, enshrined in its motto: Crescat scientia; vita excolatur (“Let knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched”). The university has lived up to this by being at the forefront of major academic endeavour and discovery. It has connections to more than 80 Nobel laureates, 30 National Medal winners (across humanities, arts and science) and nine Fields Medallists. It has also been awarded nearly 50 MacArthur “genius grants”.Current faculty who have won a Nobel prize while at Chicago include economists Robert E. Lucas (1995), James J. Heckman (2000), Roger Myerson (2007), Lars Peter Hansen (2013), Eugene Fama (2013), and physicist James Cronin (1980). Ngô Bao Châu, the first Vietnamese to win the Fields Medal (2010), is the Francis and Rose Yuen distinguished service professor in Chicago’s department of mathematics.Notable alumni of Chicago include authors Saul Bellow and Susan Sontag, astronomer Edwin Hubble, film critic Roger Ebert, and everyone’s favourite celluloid academic and archaeologist, Indiana Jones – who also taught at the university.While Chicago routinely ranks in the world’s top institutions academically, its prowess extends to the sporting arena. It was a founding member of the Big Ten Conference, the oldest, highest-level intercollegiate athletics conference in the US. Today the university sponsors 19 intercollegiate sports, which cater for more than 500 participants and 330 competitions taking place each year. They all play under the same name, “the Maroons”, which the university was nicknamed on account of its official colour.The university’s campus sprawls over more than 210 acres in the Hyde Park and Woodlawn neighbourhoods, which lie south of downtown Chicago. Its first buildings were modelled on the Gothic style of the University of Oxford, but by the mid-20th century, modern buildings had begun popping up to intersperse old and new. It now blends a mix of classical and contemporary architecture from the Mitchell Tower and Robie House, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s historic residence, through to the Laird Bell Law Quadrangle.The city of Chicago itself is the university’s “laboratory, playground, and muse”, with downtown highlights encompassing restaurants, shopping and cultural attractions. In one day you could visit the Navy Pier amusement park, the Art Institute of Chicago or shop on the Magnificent Mile.With satellite campuses and facilities overseas, UChicago has transcended its US geography to make itself an international institution.

At its campus in Ann Arbor, west of Detroit, cows owned by the faculty once grazed, and as late as 1845, wheat was grown on site as part of a janitor’s remuneration.By 1866, the university had become the largest in the country. Now, the University of Michigan is one of the biggest research universities in the United States. It boasts alumni including Gerald Ford, former US president; Larry Page, co-founder of Google; and actor James Earl Jones, the voice of Darth Vader.The university’s sporting tradition began in 1865, and its sports teams, collectively known as the Michigan Wolverines, have won more than 50 national championships in 12 sports. Why the wolverine became the university’s mascot is a mystery, as although the nickname caught on in the middle of the 19th century, the first verified sighting of the animal in Michigan state did not occur until 2004.Michigan’s mission is to serve the people of Michigan and the world through “preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future”. It offers 250 undergraduate majors, 100 doctoral and 200 master’s programmes, as well as more than 1,400 student clubs.The university has no shortage of bizarre traditions. On campus sits “The Cube”, a huge black object so finely balanced on one corner that students can spin it around despite its great weight. One myth is that the president gives it a push each morning in order to keep the campus running smoothly.When students first arrive at Michigan they walk through a campus fountain to make them an “official wolverine”. After graduation, they walk the other way through the water, signifying their departure to join the professional world.

They began planning in 1850 and, three years later, boldly went ahead and purchased a 379-acre site close to Lake Michigan and developed the campus at Evanston, named after a founder called John Evans.From these small beginnings, Northwestern has developed into a leading private research university with a strong interdisciplinary culture and a commitment to teaching excellence. It now consists of 12 separate schools and colleges and is notable for its research strength in fields including neuroscience, nanotechnology, biotechnology and the development of new drugs. The main campus is still based at Evanston, 10 miles north of Chicago, although there is a smaller one in Chicago, so students enjoy all the stimulus and opportunities for personal and professional development provided by one of the world’s great cities. Since 2008, there has also been a third, satellite campus in Doha, Qatar.Northwestern’s mascot is Willy the Wildcat. Its mottoes are both taken from the New Testament and read, in Latin and Greek, “Whatsoever things are true” and “The world is full of grace and truth”.Celebrated alumni include novelist Saul Bellow and economist George Stigler, who both went on to win Nobel Prizes, as well as Friends star David Schwimmer,Gone Girlauthor Gillian Flynn, and George R. R. Martin, whose novels inspired the Game of Thrones television series. No fewer than four economists and one chemist who worked as faculty at Northwestern went to receive Nobel Prizes.

It is part of the Ivy League and, as an institution that prides itself on openness, was the first of the members to accept students from all religious affiliations.Originally called the College of Rhode Island, Brown’s first home was Warren, Rhode Island before it relocated to College Hill, overlooking the state’s capital city Providence, in 1770. Some 34 years later, in recognition of a $5,000 gift from alumnus and leading Providence businessman Nicholas Brown, the university was renamed to reflect today’s title.Today’s picturesque campus is made up of 230 buildings over 150 acres within walking distance of downtown Providence and close to the lively Thayer Street, Wickenden Street and Wayland Square where students and local residents mix, among ample shopping, dining and entertainment.The university’s sports teams play under the name of the “Brown Bears”. Theodore Francis Green, a former Rhode Island governor and US senator, introduced a brown bear as the university’s mascot. Today, Bruno the Brown bear is still the university’s prime cheerleader.A defining characteristic of the university was its introduction of the “Brown Curriculum”, which altered undergraduate education immeasurably at the institution. It was inspired by Francis Wyland, Brown’s fourth president, who argued that a student should have the freedom to “study what he chose, all that he chose, and nothing but what he chose”. The new “Open Curriculum”, which was launched in 1970, allowed students to develop their own core curriculum rather than be bound to a prescribed “liberal arts education”. It has defined Brown’s undergraduate experience to this day.Besides study, Brown is a leading research institution. The university has connections to seven Nobel laureates including alumni Craig C. Mello and Jerry White who won for physiology or medicine and peace respectively, and current physics faculty member Leon Cooper. Fields Medal winner David Mumford is emeritus professor of applied mathematics at the university.Brown’s diverse student body is exemplified by notable alumni from all walks of life. From the father of American education Horace Mann and The Office star John Krasinski, to Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark and financier and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, the university’s people are varied.

In 1853, shortly after Governor Thomas Brown passed a bill offering financial support, a man called Gilbert Kingsbury opened the East Florida Seminary. This eventually merged with the former Florida Agricultural College, the St Petersburg Normal and Industrial School and the South Florida Military College in 1905 to become the new University of the State of Florida. The relevant legislation was known as the Buckman Act and its originator, Henry Holland Buckman, is honoured in the university’s Buckman Hall.Major developments soon followed. In 1906, the Florida Museum of Natural History was incorporated into UF. As well as being invaluable for teaching and research, this represented a commitment to the study of biological diversity still significant almost a century later in 2000, when the McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity was established as one of the largest collections of butterflies and moths in the world. In 1909, president Albert Murphree reorganised the separate colleges under a single mission and greatly expanded the size of the institution, with an annual intake rising from 200 to over 2,000.Major developments in the 20th century include the creation of the Colleges of Medicine and Nursing in 1956 and a teaching hospital two years later. By building on these, UF is now the only university in the country which incorporates six different healthcare colleges on a single campus. A different landmark was reached in 1968, when the first ever “Gator” took part in the Olympics.Since the millennium, the university has remained at the forefront of research in many areas, often through high-profile international collaborations. In 2002, it led a consortium of seven universities which secured a $15 million grant from NASA to carry out space research. From 2008, a partnership with Zhejiang University in China worked on sustainable energy. In 2012, over 30 UF physicists, postdocs and students played a leading part in the team whose experiments at the Large Hadron Collider established that the elusive Higgs boson really existed. The university continues to work with Spain on the world’s largest single-aperture optical telescope.In 2014, the total number of students who had graduated from UF reached half a million. Notable alumni include actress Faye Dunaway, astronaut Kevin Ford and senior senator of Florida Marco Rubio.",https://www.ufl.edu/

The university has been consistently highly ranked among similar research institutions both inside and outside the US.The idea for the establishment of the university came as a direct result of a bid to the governing board of the University of California system to equip Santa Cruz with a competitive public institution of higher education.Opened in the fall of 1965, the university is committed to equipping students with the most relevant and up-to-date knowledge in their chosen academic discipline. With over 60 undergraduate and 40 graduate degree programs, UCSC has developed itself as an arena for interdisciplinary education and research opportunities in arts, engineering, humanities, physical and biological sciences, and social sciences.Covering over 810 hectares of land surrounded by Santa Cruz Mountains, the main university campus hosts 10 residential colleges, and the modern McHenry library, gathering publications related to arts, humanities and social sciences.Alongside their work on campus, scholars are also encouraged to benefit from the university’s strong connections and complete work experience in the industry. Alternatively, students can choose to complete a yearlong exchange programme with a partner university, such as the University of New Mexico or the University of New Hampshire.The university attempts to act as a driver of change in the local area, encouraging sustainability initiatives which are an integral part of life on campus. UCSC has made a considerable effort related to preservation of local water resources, traffic reduction and recycling, and was able to achieve a notable reduction in traffic congestion locally, among other things.Famous people to name UCSC as their alma-mater include film director Cary Fukunaga and CEO of Buzzfeed and the Huffington Post, Jonah Peretti.",https://www.ucsc.edu/

Founded in 1842 by Reverend Edward F. Sorin, a priest of the French missionary order known as the Congregation of the Holy Cross, it was established with the aim of being one of America’s great Catholic universities.Priests of the Holy Cross governed the university until 1967, when it shifted into a two-tiered system of governance made up of both lay and religious trustees and fellows. While remaining true to its religious roots and traditions, it now claims to be “dedicated to religious belief no less than scientific fact” and stands for “values in a world of facts”.Today, the private, coeducational research institution offers 67 undergraduate studies degree programmes within four colleges. These are the College of Arts and Letters, College of Science, Mendoza College of Business, and the College of Engineering. In addition, it is home to the School of Architecture, the First Year of Studies, and the Graduate School, Notre Dame serves around 12,000 students in all.Its Graduate School was established in 1918 and is made up of four divisions: Engineering, Humanities, Science, and Social Science. Comprising 30 departments and serving over 2,000 students, it offers 26 doctoral degree programmes, 11 masters’ degrees, and four professional masters’ degrees. Around 97 per cent of students in the Graduate School receive full-tuition scholarships.The university campus is spread across 1,261 acres and houses 171 buildings at a value of roughly $3.3 billion. The university’s operating budget is more than $1.5 billion with an endowment valued at close to $10 billion. Its expenditure from outside sources and research awards exceeds £130 million. The majority of this is federal government funding, while the remainder comes from industrial, foundation and other sponsors.In international terms, Notre Dame attracts over 1,100 students from nearly 90 countries worldwide. As well as this, within its various academic departments, it hosts more than 350 international scholars annually.It is estimated that more than half of the university’s undergraduate students embark on a year abroad during their time there. Destinations for study include countries from Australia to Brazil, China to France, Israel to Uganda, and many more in between.Adding to the university’s international status, is its network of six ‘Global Gateways’ for academic and cultural exchange, located in Beijing, Chicago, Dublin, Jerusalem, London and Rome.",https://www.nd.edu/

It was George Washington himself who envisioned a university in the United States capital in his last will and testament, to serve as an intellectual hub for the entire country.It boasts three campuses – Foggy Bottom, Mount Vernon and the Virginia Science and Technology campus – so close to the heart of power that parts of the university are just a four-block walk to the White House, not to mention many other governmental and private agencies, providing huge internship and job opportunities for students.The university’s graduates have helped shape US history: it counts five Supreme Court justices among its alumni. Politicians Colin Powell and John Foster Dulles, as well as former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover and former first lady Jackie Kennedy also went to George Washington.George Washington was the backdrop to several momentous events in 20th-century history. In 1939, a conference on campus revealed that Otto Hahn had successfully split the atom; while in 1981, the university hospital treated Ronald Reagan after an attempted assassination.But the university is not just about politics. George Washington boasts a thriving arts scene, with several student dance groups, improvisation and theatre clubs, art galleries, as well as instrumental and voice ensembles.The university’s Lisner Auditorium has hosted appearances ranging from Betty White and Al Gore to Salman Rushdie. It has a wide range of fine art, music, theatre and dance scholarships on offer to freshmen.Based in Washington, students have access to some of the finest libraries, museums and arts venues in the country. It also has a strong athletic tradition, stretching back to the late 19th century.The university launched collegiate basketball in 1906, just as the sport was in its infancy. George Washington also has an impressive record in soccer, baseball and athletics.There are no fewer than six busts of George Washington himself on campus, and the university colours of buff and blue are those the general wore into battle.It has two mascots: an official namesake mascot called George, completed with powdered wig and tricorne hat; and an unofficial hippo mascot, which appears around campus and at events.",https://www.gwu.edu/

It grew out of the Chicago College of Pharmacy, founded in 1859, after which it joined forces with other medical colleges in the region.Although UIC’s origins are rooted in healthcare – the university lays claim to the largest medical school in the US – its 15 colleges offer programmes spanning liberal arts, social work and engineering, as well as sciences and health.The institution now comprises over 29,000 students and is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse student bodies in America.UIC’s first campus, at the junction of the Greektown and Little Italy districts of Chicago, meant that many students were the first in their families to attend college (and still remain so, to this day).During a period of rapid student expansion in the 1960s, the renowned Chicago architect Walter Netsch was asked to design buildings that would accommodate a growing student community in what was a small area of land. His response was to construct them in a series of concentric rings, the inspiration for which was a droplet of water.Netsch’s brutalist style dominates UIC’s east campus, which is nicknamed ‘Circle’ after the major expressway that runs alongside it.Extra-curricular activities at UIC are in plentiful supply. Sports facilities include a gym, volleyball and racquetball courts, running paths, climbing walls and an outdoor field complex comprising 214,000 square feet of synthetic turf for soccer and baseball games. A separate outdoor facility has tennis and basketball courts, along with swimming pools, saunas and a wellness centre.At the beginning of each academic year, UIC also hosts a free ‘back to school’ music festival on campus exclusively for students. A 10,000-seater, multi-purpose arena on campus allows for easy access to other major concerts and productions, while a contemporary art space, called Gallery 400, is at the centre of the Chicago arts scene.Away from campus, UIC students have the opportunity to take part in one of the university’s many study abroad programmes that include, among other things, interning at the German Bundestag and working for a member of the German Parliament.",https://www.uic.edu/

By 1866, a local bishop, George M Randall, had recognised the need to bring higher education to the region and set to work constructing a university that would include a school of mines.When Mines opened in 1874, the focus of its early academic programmes was on gold and silver, and their extraction. Students could take courses in chemistry, metallurgy, mineralogy, mining engineering, geology, botany, drawing and maths.Today, Mines priortises ‘understanding the Earth, harnessing energy and sustaining the environment’ with a science and engineering curriculum that emphasises ‘responsible stewardship of the earth and its resources.’The university’s campus is home to both award-winning modern buildings and historical architecture restored to its former glory.

In the 1890s, a law school and graduate school were founded – the latter being the first of its kind west of the Mississippi River. In 1896, it also awarded its first doctorate degrees, again making it one of the first of its kind west of the Mississippi. The campuses have botanical gardens and arboreta, a hallmark of UNL as the birthplace of ecology.Today UNL has 10 colleges that cover science and the humanities. Its primary area of focus is undergraduate education. It runs several programmes that reflect this, such as  the Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experiences Program (UCARE), which allows students and staff to work together on project, and the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management, which teaches students about technology and management, as well as essential leadership skills.UNL’s research expenditure in 2013 was almost $270 million, with almost $100 million in federal research and expenditures in the National Science Foundation, the Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institutes of Health.Nearly 80 per cent of the student population comes from Nebraska, with the remainder coming from the rest of the US and more than 100 other countries. Of its alumni, three have won a Nobel Prize and eight have won a Pulitzer.The university's 624-acre campus is situated in the city of Lincoln with a population of more than 250,000. The city contains a high number of parks and in 2013 the Pinnacle Bank Arena was constructed, with a surrounding entertainment district.",	https://www.unl.edu

In addition, there is the South Carolina Honors College, which offers a liberal arts-style education in a state university setting.USC has seven satellite campuses, which offer a range of degrees and qualifications. It also runs an innovation district called Innovista, looking to commercialise research in key areas of strength such as biomedicine, nanotechnology, environmental science and alternative fuels.The history of the university stretches back to 1801, when South Carolina College was established as part of the Southern public college movement which was encouraged by Thomas Jefferson.The institution flourished in the decades prior to the American Civil War, with the historic horseshoe-shaped campus district which still stands today taking shape during this era.But the war had a devastating impact on the institution, forcing its closure in 1863 as students volunteered for Confederate service.The institution was re-established in 1865 as the University of South Carolina, and led the way on racial integration for a time, enrolling its first black students in 1873 – the only southern state university to do so.However, funding shortages forced the closure of the university again in 1877, and it reopened three years later as an all-white agricultural college. Black students were not admitted again until 1863.Nowadays, the Irvin department of rare books and special collections is home to the world’s largest collection of works by Ernest Hemingway and the largest collection of Robert Burns works and associated Scottish literature outside Scotland.Alumni and sports teams at the institution are known as Gamecocks.Prominent USC alumni include former White House chief of staff Andrew Card and US senator Lindsey Graham.
